== Installation ==

2. Upload a mobile theme to the '/wp-content/themes/' folder and customize it
3. Activate the plugin

5. Select a mobile compatible Wordpress theme

== Remove plugin ==

It's best to use the build in delete function of wordpress. That way all the stored data will be removed and no orphaned data will stay.

Check you website with [mobiReady](http://ready.mobi/launch.jsp?locale=en_EN). This will give you an answer

You can start your search at [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/search.php?q=mobile)

Find yourselself a good mobile theme. Use it to work on a derivated [child theme](http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes) (never touch the original theme!)

= How can I test my theme? =

I use the [Opera Mobile Emulator](http://www.opera.com/developer/tools/mobile/). Start a new emulation and type "opera:config" into URL. That way you can change the Mobile user agent string to your gusto. Or take [user agent switcher plugin for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/user-agent-switcher/?src=search)
